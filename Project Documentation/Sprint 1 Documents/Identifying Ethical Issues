Identify Ethical Issues

Ethics in project management ensure success, and accountability. Prioritising ethics builds stakeholder confidence, fosters communication, and maintains integrity.
Project managers must navigate ethical dilemmas, balancing conflicting interests while maintaining integrity for successful outcomes and strong relationships. [1]
Developing a website for sharing outfits for special occasions needs several ethical considerations that line up with established project management principles.

Misrepresentation of project status
Issue: user may upload misleading images or inaccurate descriptions of outfits, leading to dissatisfaction or disputes.
Solution: foster a culture of honesty and integrity empowering project managers to provide transparent update. Conduct regular audits to ensure accuracy and address issues early. Create a safe space to report concerns, prompting trust and informed decisions. [1]

Lack of diversity
Issue: the website may exclude or overlook the needs of diverse cultural, social, or demographic groups, limiting engagement and representation.
Solution: managing teams and stakeholders from various cultural backgrounds requires sensitivity and inclusivity to ensure effective collaboration and project success.[1]

Data Privacy and security
Issue: the user will provide personal data, including contact information or payment information. Failure to secure the data will result in privacy breaches.
Solution: protecting user data. Implement robust data protection measures to prevent unauthorised access and misuse of personal data.[2]

Conflict of interest
Issue: team members may favour certain users when allocating resources, leading to unfair access to shared outfits.
Solution: ethical project management ensures trust, accountability, and integrity. Misrepresentation can lead to major failures. Avoiding conflicts of interest is crucial for success.[1][3]

Health and safety concerns
Issue: spreads of infections or skin conditions due to unclean or untreated garments. Users might pass on bacteria, or allergens unknowingly, leading to health risks.
Solution: the platform needs to ensure proper hygiene standards and user awareness to prevent such health and safety concerns.[4] 

Environmental concerns
Issue: Renting clothes results in additional deliveries, increased number of travels to and from clients, and cleaning services will also proportionately increase the amount of carbon and energy being released into the environment. [5]
Solution: A solution that is more eco-friendly is the platform can ensure to use carbon-neutral deliveries or bike couriers and rely on wet-washing or ozone technology. [5]

Intellectual property
Issue: Some clothing brands may object to the idea of sharing their clothing. [6]
Solution: The platform must ensure that the clothing made available is authentic and in line with each brand's guidelines. [7]
