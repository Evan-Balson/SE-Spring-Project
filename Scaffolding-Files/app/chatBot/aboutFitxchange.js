const aboutCompany = `
The FitXchange platform is designed to facilitate the exchange of outfits for various social and professional occasions through a robust, database-driven web application. This overview highlights iterative improvements applied to the technical infrastructure, along with systematic diagrams integrated into an initial prototype that aligns with users’ goals.

Our development process was guided by user stories, ensuring that the platform addresses real-world needs and interactions. These user stories shaped the core features and provided direction for creating wireframes, which served as blueprints for the interface and interactions.

Borrowing & Returning
1. Browsing and Filtering: As a user seeking professional or special-occasion attire, I want to browse and filter a collection of outfits so that I can quickly identify pieces that match my style and event needs.
2. Authenticity and Initial Quality Assurance: As a user, I want assurance that each outfit is authentic, well-maintained, and ethically sourced so that I can feel confident in my choice and in the platform's integrity.
3. Transaction and Rental Process: As a user, I want an effortless rental process, including clear pricing, secure payment, and flexible options, so that my experience is seamless and hassle-free.
4. Delivery and Returning: As a user, I want delivery and return information to be clear and accessible so that I can easily understand my options and plan accordingly.
5. Fashion Advice and Trends: As a user unfamiliar with professional or formal dress codes, I want access to fashion tips and trends so that I can dress appropriately and stay stylish.
6. Reviews and Ratings: As a user, I want to leave and read reviews on outfits and lenders so that I can make informed decisions about rentals.

Lending
7. Creating Listings: As a user with well-maintained items that are no longer in regular use, I want to easily create detailed, visually appealing listings so that I can share my outfits with others while ensuring accurate presentation.
8. Lending Conditions: As a user, I want to define lending conditions such as rental duration, pricing, deposits, and care instructions so that I can manage risk, protect my belongings, and ensure proper use.

Administrating
9. User Verification and Security: As an administrator, I want to verify new users' identities so that the platform remains safe, transparent, and authentic for everyone.
10. Moderating and Policy Enforcement: As an administrator, I want to manage conflicts effectively and ensure adherence to platform guidelines (e.g., ethical, environmental, intellectual property) so that disputes are resolved fairly and the platform’s reputation is maintained.

Account Management
11. Sign-Up and Login: As a user, I want to create and log in to my account securely while being notified of the terms and conditions of service so that I can safely become a member of the platform.
12. Dashboard and Profile Management: As a user, I want to edit my profile information— including saved outfits or my listings— so that I can personalize my experience and keep my dashboard up to date.
